## Quick Start

```javascript
import Textbox from "carbon-react/lib/components/textbox";
```

## Designer Notes

- Use placeholder text to give the user examples of data formats (e.g. AB123456C for a UK National Insurance number).
- Use prefixes if your data always begins with a certain sequence (e.g. a UK VAT number usually starts with ‘GB’).
- If content in a textbox is never editable, think about removing the field border so it appears as static text.
- You can disable a textbox, but try to avoid this. If you need to, make it clear what the user needs to do in order to activate the textbox.
- Use wider fields for longer data (e.g. an address line), and narrower fields for shorter data (e.g. a postcode), to give the user a clue about the data expected.

## Examples

### Default

<Canvas name="default" of={TextboxStories.Default} />

### Character counter

If you use the `inputHint` prop to provide the user with a hint before the input, please use a full stop `.` at the end,
as it forces a pause before any other announcements, this well help screen reader users understand the hint fully.

<Canvas name="character counter" of={TextboxStories.CharacterCounter} />

### Character counter with translations

Various translations can be applied to both the visually hidden hint message, and the character
counter below the input.

These translations have been split up to include a number which represents the current character count which
is over/under the set `characterLimit`. Please see below how this has been achieved with a French translation.
Include the formatted number count wherever makes sense for the language you're translating too.

<Canvas
  name="character counter with translations"

### With fieldHelp

<Canvas name="with fieldHelp" of={TextboxStories.WithFieldHelp} />

### With inputHint

When the `inputHint` prop is passed, please use a full stop `.` at the end. This forces a pause 
before any other announcements, this well help screen reader users understand the hint fully.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with inputHint" story={stories.WithInputHint} />
</Canvas>

### With labelHelp

<Canvas name="with labelHelp" of={TextboxStories.WithLabelHelp} />

### Required

You can use the `required` prop to indicate if the field is mandatory.

<Canvas name="required" of={TextboxStories.Required} />

### LabelAlign

<Canvas name="labelAlign" of={TextboxStories.LabelAlign} />

### Validations

Validation status can be set by passing `error`, `warning` or `info` prop to the component

Passing a string to these props will display a properly colored border along with a validation icon and tooltip - string value will be displayed as the tooltip message.

Passing a boolean to these props will display only a properly colored border.
