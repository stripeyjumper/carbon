## Quick Start

```javascript
import LinkPreview from "carbon-react/lib/components/link-preview";
```

## Examples

### Default

By default the component will render an anchor element if it is not in a loading state. This means the whole component can
be focused via tabbing and pressing enter or clicking will open the target in a new tab. The component surfaces a range of
props which can be seen in the table below. If no `image` props are passed a placeholder will be used.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="default" story={stories.DefaultStory} />
</Canvas>

### With loading state

If no `url` is passed or the `isLoading` prop is true the component will display in a loading state. When in this state, it
renders as a `div` element: it cannot be focused via tabbing and clicking will not trigger anything.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with loading state" story={stories.LinkPreviewLoadingState} />
</Canvas>

### With close icon

If the component is rendered in edit mode as a `div` element, it is possible to pass an `onClose` callback which will render
a close icon and pass the callback to it. The icon can be focused via tabbing and the callback will be triggered via click or
via pressing enter or space when focused.

<Canvas>
  <Story name="with close icon" story={stories.LinkPreviewCloseIcon} />
</Canvas>

## Props

### LinkPreview

<StyledSystemProps margin of={LinkPreview} />
