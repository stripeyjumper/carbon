## Quick Start

To use Hr, import the `Hr` and set the margins to align it with other components.

```javascript
import Hr from "carbon-react/lib/components/hr";
```

## Examples

### Default

By default the hr is 100% width and has top and bottom margins of 24px.

<Canvas name="default" of={HrStories.Default} />

### With different vertical spacing

The `mb` and `mt` props set the vertical spacing. These props are mulitipliers and are therefore multiplied by the base theme spacing which is `8px`. The default for both is `3` and therefore `24px`.

<Canvas name="different spacing" of={HrStories.DifferentSpacing} />

### Inside a form

<Canvas name="Inside a form" of={HrStories.InsideForm} />

### Inside a form with inline labels

<Canvas
  name="Inside a form with inline labels"
  of={HrStories.InsideFormInlineLabels}
/>

### Enabling the adaptive behaviour

The left and right margins can be set to 0 below a screen width breakpoint. This can be switched on with the `adaptiveMxBreakpoint` prop by passing in a number corresponding to a px value screen width.

<Canvas
  name="Enabling adaptive behaviour"
  of={HrStories.EnablingAdaptiveBehaviour}
/>

## Props

### Hr

<ArgTypes of={HrStories} />
